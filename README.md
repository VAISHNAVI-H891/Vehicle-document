This project is based on the Android in which we can store and retrieve all the
information regarding the QR Code based vehicle Document Verification what all we require. Database is a structured format. So, if we store in the database, we can retrieve that particular
information by giving a command directly. There is no process for installing database for
mobile-phone applications. Whenever the database is needed, then only the database is created
through coding. In this project there is a feasibility to change and delete the data which is not
required.The application we are developing is about “QR Code Based Vehicle Document
Verification Android Application”. It is an android application used to find out the Information
about the vehicle document Information in day-to-day life there is lots of increment in
population. Now a day’s most of the people are using their own vehicles. Due to that road traffic
has been increased tremendously. Due to this traffic Police work has been increased. Regional
Transport office (RTO) responsible for the registration of all vehicle related document. RTO
management has lots of work related to registration of vehicle documentation. Regularly we observe that people have to stop their vehicles on the road or toll booth to
show their documents for their vehicles. This is waste of time for the driver and also for the
police who take time in checking the documents and return them back again. Sometimes the
driver forgot to carry the vehicle related documentation due to some reason and therefore he
have to pay fine. In this proposed system we solved all this issue related traffic police
management. The proposed system aim is reducing traffic police work and also driver no need
to carry vehicle document manually. If someone vehicle is robbed we can easily detect stolen
vehicle also using RFID. RTO administration stored vehicle related documentation in QR code. All this information is available internet connection is required. All we have to do is to store
the information in database.
