This project is based on the Android in which we can store and retrieve all the
information regarding the QR Code based vehicle Document Verification what all we require. Database is a structured format. So, if we store in the database, we can retrieve that particular
information by giving a command directly. There is no process for installing database for
mobile-phone applications. Whenever the database is needed, then only the database is created
through coding. In this project there is a feasibility to change and delete the data which is not
required.The application we are developing is about “QR Code Based Vehicle Document
Verification Android Application”. It is an android application used to find out the Information
about the vehicle document Information in day-to-day life there is lots of increment in
population. Now a day’s most of the people are using their own vehicles. Due to that road traffic
has been increased tremendously. Due to this traffic Police work has been increased. Regional
Transport office (RTO) responsible for the registration of all vehicle related document. RTO
management has lots of work related to registration of vehicle documentation. Regularly we observe that people have to stop their vehicles on the road or toll booth to
show their documents for their vehicles. This is waste of time for the driver and also for the
police who take time in checking the documents and return them back again. Sometimes the
driver forgot to carry the vehicle related documentation due to some reason and therefore he
have to pay fine. In this proposed system we solved all this issue related traffic police
management. The proposed system aim is reducing traffic police work and also driver no need
to carry vehicle document manually. If someone vehicle is robbed we can easily detect stolen
vehicle also using RFID. RTO administration stored vehicle related documentation in QR code. All this information is available internet connection is required. All we have to do is to store
the information in database.

CHAPTER 5
 
 RESULTANDDISCUSSION 
This part would describe the results of QR Code-Based Vehicle Document
Verification and Instant Penalty Generation. In this section, a comprehensive
explanation of how the system works with a performance evaluation as well as
discussion about its impact, benefits, and possible improvement. The developed
Android application enables traffic police officers to scan QR codes linked to vehicle
registration documents to verify instantly whether the documents are valid or not. If a
document is invalid, expired, or missing, the system automatically generates
appropriate penalty. The application demonstrates several key features designed to streamline traffic
enforcement processes. It enables instant QR code scanning through the device camera, allowing officers to retrieve real-time data from the central RTO database embedded in
vehicle documents. The automated verification process cross-checks critical details
such as vehicle registration, insurance validity, PUC status, and driving license
information, issuing alerts for discrepancies. Additionally, the system calculates
penalties automatically as per RTO norms and generates digital penalty slips, which can
be shared with violators via SMS or email. To ensure security, QR codes are encrypted
to prevent tampering, and access to sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel. The user- friendly interface prioritizes efficiency, featuring a dashboard that displays
penalties issued, pending verifications, and flagged vehicles, minimizing time spent on
manual tasks. During testing with a sample database of 1,000 vehicles, the app showcased
strong performance metrics. QR codes were scanned in under two seconds on average, and the system accurately identified 98% of expired documents while achieving 100%
accuracy in detecting fake documents or QR codes. The penalty generation module
consistently applied RTO rules to calculate fines, confirming its reliability. Overall, the
system significantly reduces manual verification efforts while enhancing the accuracy, speed, and security of traffic enforcement processes
